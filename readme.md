# GitHub Multi-Label Issue Classifier 
## 1  Abstract
  Most open source code development is done on GitHub. When errors occur, the new developer will send a bug and hopefully label it appropriately. However, they are the open source code they classify and wrong wastes more time from an overwhelmed open source maintainer. The goal is to use the data of maintainers with extensive knowledge about the open source code GitHub issues to classify issues correctly.

# Find Answers to Frequently Asked Questions
## 1 Abstract
 The most common thing that occurs for open source developers is getting asked the same question over and over again. To reduce the strain on the maintainer, you want to give a question about certain open source libraries; you can retrieve relevant answers or supporting documents. Sometimes google gives you a StackOverflow link to a question with no answers.  You can use semantic search to find the relevant answer

# Find Relevant Open Source Documentation while writing in vs code
## 1  Abstract

1. Using open source is looking through the website documentation frequently to give a particular result. Given a quick description with or without code snippets, the user will retrieve applicable documentation , stack overflow, and other to find help code snippets while in VSCode no need to go to your browser and do a quick google search

## 2 Introduction and Prior Work
Meta drop a scale corpus for better knowledge-intensive NLP. And GitHub had improved GitHub Code dramatically. Carper AI just released a code retrieval model. However, there are not many resources about exact corpus search for documentation given a code.

# Make a python code less or more pythonic
## 1  Abstract
1. The goal of the project is to use code generation to change the code snippet to make it easier. Beginners will receive code that is too pythonic and hard to understand. This will reduce the barrier to entry for new programmers in python using. In this approach, we will be using the current NLP deep learning model. 
#  Make a particular snippet of code more efficient in python
## 1.  Abstract
Python has interpreted programming language, thus making it slow compared to other programming languages. The only way to improve the user performance of the programming is to use libraries to increase performance. For example, a simple for loop has to be vectorized in NumPy to be the fastest approach. To make high-performance code requires lots of technical knowledge, while the average person using python wants to get stuff done quickly., however unable to make the program faster sometimes can break a project. In this project, you will be using the In-Filling approach using a Deep Learning model to change the code in the in-filling to increase performance and not create more errors.
